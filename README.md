- 💚 Variables: Variable is the name of a memory location which stores some data.
  Variables name convention or Rules:
- Variables are case sensitive
  1st character is alphabet or ‘_’
  No comma/blank space
  No other symbol other than ‘_’
  Data Types:
  💚 Constants: Values that don’t change (fixed)
  Types of Constants:
- Integer constants
  Real Constants
  Character Constants
  💚 Keywords: Reserved words that have special meaning to the compiler. 32 keywords in c programming language.
  💚 Comments: comments is important part programming which is give code maintain facility
  Single line comment
  Multi line comment
  ** Format Specifier **
  ** Escape Sequence**
  💚 Compilation: A computer program that translates C code into machine code.


  ## Chapter 02

### Instructions -> These are statements in a program.
- Types of Instructions:
    1. Type Declaration Instructions ___ Declare variable before using it
    2. Arithmetic Instructions ____ Note: single variable on the LHS
    3. Control Instructions

    * Type Conversion
        1. implicit conversion
        2. explicit conversion
    * Operator Precedence
        0. brackets
        1. *, /, %
        2. +, -
        3. =
        N.B -> Associativity (for same precedence): Left to Right
### Control Instructions-> used to determine flow of program
    1. Sequence Control
    2. Decision Control = if else
    3. Loop control  = for, while, do ... while 
    4. Case Control = 

### 💚Operators 
    1. Arithmetic Operaors *
    2. Relational Operators * _____ ==, >, <, <=, >=, !=
    3. Logical Operaors * ______ &&, ||, !
    4. Bitwise Operators *^, &, | *
    5. Assignment Operators *** "=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %="
    6. Ternary Operators * expree? "express": express*


 
  ###  💚Operator Precedence 
        1. *, /, % -> high precendence operator
        2. +, - -> middle precendence operator
        3. = low precendence operator
    ✔ Associativity law = Left to Right


### 💚Operators Precendence in different type operators
    | Priority  | Operator              |
    |-----------|-----------------------|
    |    1      |         !             |
    |    2      |       *, /, %         |    
    |    3      |       + , -           |    
    |    4      |       <. <=, >, >=    |
    |    5      |       ==, !=          |
    |    6      |           &&          |
    |    7      |           ||          |
    |    8      |           =           |
