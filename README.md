- ðŸ’š Variables: Variable is the name of a memory location which stores some data.
  Variables name convention or Rules:
- Variables are case sensitive
  1st character is alphabet or â€˜_â€™
  No comma/blank space
  No other symbol other than â€˜_â€™
  Data Types:
  ðŸ’š Constants: Values that donâ€™t change (fixed)
  Types of Constants:
- Integer constants
  Real Constants
  Character Constants
  ðŸ’š Keywords: Reserved words that have special meaning to the compiler. 32 keywords in c programming language.
  ðŸ’š Comments: comments is important part programming which is give code maintain facility
  Single line comment
  Multi line comment
  ** Format Specifier **
  ** Escape Sequence**
  ðŸ’š Compilation: A computer program that translates C code into machine code.


  ## Chapter 02

### Instructions -> These are statements in a program.
- Types of Instructions:
    1. Type Declaration Instructions ___ Declare variable before using it
    2. Arithmetic Instructions ____ Note: single variable on the LHS
    3. Control Instructions

    * Type Conversion
        1. implicit conversion
        2. explicit conversion
    * Operator Precedence
        0. brackets
        1. *, /, %
        2. +, -
        3. =
        N.B -> Associativity (for same precedence): Left to Right
### Control Instructions-> used to determine flow of program
    1. Sequence Control
    2. Decision Control = if else
    3. Loop control  = for, while, do ... while 
    4. Case Control = 


 ### *  Operators 
    -> Operator Precedence 
        1. *, /, % -> high precendence operator
        2. +, - -> middle precendence operator
        3. = low precendence operator
    -> Associativity law = Left to Right
